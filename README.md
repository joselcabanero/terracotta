# Terracotta — the Eatable Adventures Design System

**Terracotta** is the reusable design system for **Eatable Adventures' apps and proprietary products**, adapted directly from the **2026 Brandbook** (brand refresh). *(Terracotta is the name of the system; Eatable Adventures is the brand it expresses.)* Eatable Adventures is the operating system for food innovation — accelerator, consultancy and fund in one — built to turn ambition into measurable business results.

This folder gives a design agent everything needed to produce on-brand interfaces, mockups, prototypes and slides: design tokens (color + Rubik type), a flexible grid, the brand assets, written tone/voice guidance, specimen cards, a brand foundations one-pager, and a ready-to-use app-shell template.

> **Brand: "The Beating Heart of Food Innovation."** From the heartbeat comes a visual system built on three ideas — **pulse, rhythm and impact**. It is warm, human and premium without arrogance. Type is **Rubik** (the only family), color is **EAV Red + warm creams**, surfaces are **rounded**, and energy is **contained**: red, the light point and gradients activate a composition without making it noisy.

## Brand intensity — restrained, intermediate, high

The identity is **not** applied the same way everywhere. There is an expression scale:

- **Restrained** — consulting, data pages, reports, **proprietary products & apps**. White, creams, Rubik, structure and subtle accents dominate; reading takes priority over the brand gesture.
- **Intermediate** — internal/sales decks, methodology pages. Photography, modules, dividers and a more visible use of the system.
- **High** — covers, campaigns, web heroes. Darker backgrounds, dominant red, hero photography, the main gradient, a strong claim.

**This system is tuned for the restrained end** (apps and product UI), with the higher-expression devices available for hero/brand moments. Lower the intensity as information density rises; raise it when a piece needs to position or sell.

## Design principles

1. **Operational clarity** — through typography and composition. Direct headlines, clean modules, clear hierarchy and enough air. Sophistication lies in judgment, not complexity.
2. **Contained energy** — through color and graphic elements. Intensity, but precise, not chaotic. The red, light point and gradients activate without noise.
3. **Real humanity** — through photography and tone. People, contexts, processes and decisions feel close, in action and tangible — never cold or abstract.

Together: **structure with movement**, a **premium presence without arrogance**. The brand does not shout, but it does not disappear either.

## VISUAL FOUNDATIONS

### Color — two mother colors, one warm system
The palette is born from **EAV Red** and **EAV Cream** and expands into a warm, functional set. Color is **structural, not decorative**, applied with a clear hierarchy.

- **EAV Red `#BC2D29`** — the brand's representative color: identity, active state, links, focus, CTAs. Used as a field or marker, never a soft tint.
- **White `#FFFFFF`** — the most predominant color; balances the gradients with cleanliness and air.
- **EAV Cream `#FFF9EE`** — highlighted/editorial blocks and product grounds.
- **EAV Black `#1E1E1E`** — footers and typography (primary text).
- **Secondary:** Dark Cream `#F5EACE` (secondary gradients), Light Grey `#FAFAFA` & Grey `#E8E8E8` (consulting blocks/dividers), **Yellow `#FFA103` (light point only)**, **Orange `#DE5533` (gradient transition only)**, **Burgundy `#450E14` (closings, CTAs, depth)**.
- **Warm text ramp (derived):** fg1 `#1E1E1E` · fg2 `#574E48` · fg3 `#857B72` · fg4 `#ABA197`.

Don't introduce colors outside the approved palette, don't use yellow/orange as hero colors outside the gradient, and don't oversaturate a piece with reds.

### Type — Rubik, and only Rubik
- **One family:** Rubik (Light 300 · Regular 400 · Medium 500 · Bold 700 · Extrabold 800 + italics). There is **no secondary typeface**. A system mono is kept *only* as a functional fallback for code/tabular data.
- **Headlines** are Rubik **Regular** with an initial capital, emphasis carried by a single **bold fragment** — and at most one word may turn **red** (headlines only). **Eyebrows** are Regular, UPPERCASE, tracked. **Body** is Regular with bold highlights; long-form moves to Light with Medium highlights.
- Hierarchy comes from **weight + size + position**, not from a second face. Paragraphs are left-aligned, never justified.
- **Scale (base 16):** 12 · 13 · 14 · 16 · 18 · 22 · 28 · 36 · 46 · 60 · 76.

### Grid, spacing & layout
- A **flexible grid, 1–4 columns by content hierarchy** (a 12-column backbone subdivides cleanly and stays useful for data-dense product UI). `.swiss-container` → `.swiss-grid` → `.col-N` / `.start-N`.
- **8px baseline.** All spacing is a multiple of 8 (`--b1…--b12`; 4 is the half-step). Consistent margins, well-separated blocks, **enough air**.

### Borders, elevation & shape
- **Rounded by rule.** Cards, boxes, inputs and pills curve (`--radius-sm 6 · md 10 · lg 16 · xl 24 · pill 999`). Rounding drops only when a block bleeds to the format edge.
- **Soft, warm elevation.** Flat or `--shadow-sm` at rest; lift only when floating (dialog/popover). Warm hairline dividers (`--border-1`); the structural ink keyline is reserved for emphasis.

### Graphic elements — pulse, rhythm, impact
The heartbeat in the form of light. **Pulse** activates (CTAs); **Rhythm** organises movement (programs, activity); **Impact** shows change (results, proof). Concretely in this system:
- **Main brand gradient** — radial Yellow→Orange→Red→Burgundy. **Hero / brand moments only.**
- **Secondary cream gradient** — a clean, soft pause for product surfaces.
- **CTA pulse** — a soft same-color expansion on action (the button's heartbeat).
- **Light point** — an EAV Yellow pulse that activates one focus; over white, cream or photography only. Signals, never decorates.

### Components
Exported React components live in `components/` — each ships as a `.jsx` implementation, a `.d.ts` contract and a standalone HTML specimen:
- **Button** — `components/Button.jsx` (`Button.d.ts`, specimen `button.html`). Rubik pill with the CTA pulse on hover. Variants: `primary` (EAV Red), `cta` (burgundy, cream text), `outline` (red border/text), `ghost`. Sizes `md` / `sm`; optional Material Symbols icon; disabled renders at 40%.

### Charts & data visualization
Color is assigned by **relevance**, in a fixed order: **Red → Orange → Burgundy → Yellow → Dark Cream → Grey (neutral) → Black (axes/text)**. Seventeen chart types are specified in `Charts Catalogue.html` (and as `preview/chart-*` cards): KPI tiles, bar, horizontal bars, line, area, donut, stacked bars, funnel, progress-vs-target, heatmap, sunburst, timeline/Gantt, radar, scatter, waterfall, treemap, sankey. Max five series; no 3D, shadows or full pies; the only in-chart gradients are the area fade and heatmap ramp.

### Motion
Quick and contained: short fades, the CTA pulse, soft hover lifts. **No** bounces, springs, parallax or looping decoration — interaction changes color/elevation, not size.

### Interaction states
- **Hover:** ground shift / soft lift; links turn red.
- **Active nav:** white pill + soft shadow + **3px red marker** + red label.
- **Press:** red → `--brand-strong`; burgundy deepens. **Focus:** red ring. **Disabled:** ~40% + `not-allowed`.

## CONTENT FUNDAMENTALS — voice & copy

Terse, concrete and proof-driven — **confident, not arrogant**. The register of a working operating system, not a consumer brand.

- **No empty words.** Nothing any other company could say; if it isn't concrete information, it isn't published.
- **Grounded in reality.** Real data and cases, not aspirations. Every message answers: *what does this provide in business terms?*
- **Casing:** eyebrows/section dividers UPPERCASE & tracked; titles sentence/Title case; buttons sentence case; table headers UPPERCASE 11px bold.
- **Brand names, written exactly:** **Eatable Adventures** · **The Beating Heart of Food Innovation** · **Let's Beat**.

**Do:** "We work from challenge to validated pilot. In 6 to 12 months." · "70 companies have executed real projects with us."
**Don't:** "We catalyze the global food ecosystem to co-create holistic impact 🚀"

---

## ICONOGRAPHY

- **Google Material Symbols (Outlined)** — `Weight 300`, `Grade 0`, `Optical Size 48`, outline. Rendered ~18–22px in UI, as **functional support** placed near the content it introduces — secondary in scale, never hero or decorative. Load from Google Fonts; do **not** hand-roll SVG icons or use emoji.
- **Logo:** `assets/logo.svg` — the single-color "Eatable Adventures" wordmark. Positive (black or EAV Red on white/cream) or negative (white on black, red or approved gradients). In compact product chrome the identity is an **app mark**: a rounded EAV Red tile with `EA` in Rubik bold, paper-white.
- **Imagery:** warm or neutral, natural light, authentic; people in action (researching, producing, validating, deciding). Avoid generic stock and cold, abstract tech imagery. Use subtly-striped placeholders with a short label where a real image will drop in.

## How to use this system

1. **Link the tokens, then the grid:** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="colors_and_type.css">` then `<link rel="stylesheet" href="grid.css">` (or just `styles.css`).
2. **Choose your brand intensity first** — restrained for apps/data, higher for covers/heroes.
3. **EAV Red + warm creams + Rubik.** Red as the mark; cream blocks for emphasis; the neutral ramp for hierarchy. Yellow only as the light point, orange only inside the gradient, burgundy for depth.
4. **Rounded surfaces, pill buttons, the CTA pulse on action.** Soft warm dividers; shadows only when floating.
5. **Start from `templates/app-shell/`** for anything app-like, and from `Brand Foundations.html` to see the system whole.
6. **Icons:** Material Symbols Outlined (weight 300), functional and secondary.
